## About
ServerDuino is an open source hardware/software application which allows you to 
monitor your serveroom.

It allows you to monitor:
* Pressure
* Tempreature 
* Humidity 
* Light 

## How it Works
The Arduino Script monitors with it's sensors pressure, tempreature humidity and 
light in the room. A JSON String will be generated by the script. A cronjob (executed 
every three minutes) executes a PHP Script, which opens an HTTP Connection (Yes the 
Arduino has a Builtin WebServer), reads the JSON-String  decodes the JSON String and 
adds the data to a graph generated by the RRD-Tool

It also generates a PDF containing the different diagrams. 

## Dependencies (Software)

* PHP5 
* FPDF (PHP Library for generating on the fly PDF's)
