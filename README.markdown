Charel Buchler (charel.buchler@caritas.lu)

ServerDuino was mainly developed for Caritas Luxembourg, but we decided after on to 
release the project for the open source community together with Caritas Luxembourg.

## How it Works
The Arduino Script monitors with it's sensors pressure, tempreature humidity and 
light in the room. A JSON String will be generated by the script. A cronjob (executed 
every three minutes) executes a PHP Script, which opens an HTTP Connection (Yes the 
Arduino has a Builtin WebServer), reads the JSON-String  decodes the JSON String and 
adds the data to a graph generated by the RRD-Tool

It also generates a PDF containing the different diagrams.
